# PastaAndPizzaz Delivery

A nice way of implementing a navigation drawer for an Android app. The project
serves as a feature demonstration and doesn't have functional delivery
capabilities.

## Features

- [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro): Built
  using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
- **Architecture
  **: [Monolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_architecture).
- **Collapsing Toolbar**: For a smooth and dynamic UI.
- **Grid of Pizzas**: Displays pizzas on the main screen; clicking opens a
  details screen.
- **Order Form**: A "+" button in the app bar opens a form to order pizza.
- **Share Button**: Includes options for Bluetooth and Nearby sharing.
- **Code Readability:** code is easily readable with no unnecessary blank
  lines, no unused variables or methods, and no commented-out code, all
  variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another
  developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
